# RabbitMQ case

### Business scenario: Throttling

Suppose you have a lot of clients, who sleep at night, 
and produce a lot of traffic during daylight. 

You want to process all
this traffic, but you don't have enough power to do a realtime(online) processing.

So you store the data and then process it.
